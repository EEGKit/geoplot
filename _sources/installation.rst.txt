============
Installation
============

``geoplot`` supports Python 3.7 and higher.

With Conda (Recommended)
------------------------

If you haven't already, `install conda <https://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_. Then run
``conda install geoplot -c conda-forge`` and you're done. This works on all platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

Without Conda
-------------

You can install ``geoplot`` using ``pip install geoplot``. Use caution however, as this probably will not work on
Windows, and possibly will not work on macOS and Linux.
